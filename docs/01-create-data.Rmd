## Introduction
This notebook creates the crime data sets needed for the geocoder analyses.

## Dependencies
This notebook requires a number of packages to working with data and wrangling it.

```{r load-packages}
# tidystl packages
library(compstatr)


# tidyverse packages
library(dplyr)

# spatial packages


# other packages
library(testthat)
```

## Prepare Data
### Download Crime Data
The initial step is to create an index of data available from the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department's website:

```{r create-index}
i <- cs_create_index()
```

With the index created, we can create separate raw crime objects by year:

```{r load-data}
data2018_raw <- cs_get_data(year = 2018, index = i)
data2017_raw <- cs_get_data(year = 2017, index = i)
data2016_raw <- cs_get_data(year = 2016, index = i)
data2015_raw <- cs_get_data(year = 2015, index = i)
data2014_raw <- cs_get_data(year = 2014, index = i)
data2013_raw <- cs_get_data(year = 2013, index = i)
data2012_raw <- cs_get_data(year = 2012, index = i)
data2011_raw <- cs_get_data(year = 2011, index = i)
data2010_raw <- cs_get_data(year = 2010, index = i)
data2009_raw <- cs_get_data(year = 2009, index = i)
data2008_raw <- cs_get_data(year = 2008, index = i)
```

### 2018
We validate the data to make sure it can be collapsed using `cs_validate()`:

```{r validate-data18}
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2018_raw, year = "2018"), TRUE)
```

Since the validation result is a value of `TRUE`, we can proceed to collapsing the year-list object into a single tibble with `cs_collapse()` and then stripping out crimes reported in 2018 for earlier years using `cs_combine()`. We also strip out unfounded crimes that remain using `cs_filter_count()`:

```{r collapse-data18}
# collapse into single object
data2018_raw <- cs_collapse(data2018_raw)

# combine and filter
cs_combine(type = "year", date = 2018, data2018_raw) %>%
  cs_filter_count(var = count) -> crime2018
```

The `data2018` object now contains only crimes reported in 2018.

### 2017
We'll repeat the validation process with the 2017 data:

```{r validate-data17}
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2017_raw, year = "2017"), FALSE)
```

Since we fail the validation, we can use the `verbose = TRUE` option to get a summary of where validation issues are occurring. 

```{r validate-data17-verbose}
cs_validate(data2017_raw, year = "2017", verbose = TRUE)
```

The data for May 2017 do not pass the validation checks. We can extract this month and confirm that there are too many columns in the May 2017 release. Once we have that confirmed, we can standardize that month and re-run our validation.

```{r fix-may17}
# extract data and unit test column numbers
expect_equal(ncol(cs_extract_month(data2017_raw, month = "May")), 26)

# standardize months
data2017_raw <- cs_standardize(data2017_raw, month = "May", config = 26)

# validate data
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2017_raw, year = "2017"), TRUE)
```

We now get a `TRUE` value for `cs_validate()` and can move on to collapsing the 2017 and 2018 raw data objects to create a new object, `crime2017`, that contains all known 2017 crimes including those that were reported or upgraded in 2018.

```{r collapse-data17}
# collapse into single object
data2017_raw <- cs_collapse(data2017_raw)
# combine and filter
cs_combine(type = "year", date = 2017, data2018_raw, data2017_raw) %>%
  cs_filter_count(var = count) -> crime2017
```

### 2016
We'll repeat the validation process with the 2016 data:

```{r validate-data16}
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2016_raw, year = "2016"), TRUE)
```

Since the validation process passes, we can immediately move on to creating our 2016 data object:

```{r collapse-data16}
# collapse into single object
data2016_raw <- cs_collapse(data2016_raw)

# combine and filter
cs_combine(type = "year", date = 2016, data2018_raw, data2017_raw, data2016_raw) %>%
  cs_filter_count(var = count) -> crime2016
```

### 2015
We'll repeat the validation process with the 2015 data:

```{r validate-data15}
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2015_raw, year = "2015"), TRUE)
```

Since the validation process passes, we can immediately move on to creating our 2015 data object:

```{r collapse-data15}
# collapse into single object
data2015_raw <- cs_collapse(data2015_raw)

# combine and filter
cs_combine(type = "year", date = 2015, data2018_raw, data2017_raw, data2016_raw, data2015_raw) %>%
  cs_filter_count(var = count) -> crime2015
```

### 2014
We'll repeat the validation process with the 2014 data:

```{r validate-data14}
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2014_raw, year = "2014"), TRUE)
```

Since the validation process passes, we can immediately move on to creating our 2014 data object:

```{r collapse-data14}
# collapse into single object
data2014_raw <- cs_collapse(data2014_raw)

# combine and filter
cs_combine(type = "year", date = 2014, data2018_raw, data2017_raw, data2016_raw, data2015_raw, data2014_raw) %>%
  cs_filter_count(var = count) -> crime2014
```

### 2013
We'll repeat the validation process with the 2013 data:

```{r validate-data13}
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2013_raw, year = "2013"), FALSE)
```

Since we fail the validation, we can use the `verbose = TRUE` option to get a summary of where validation issues are occuring. 

```{r validate-data13-verbose}
cs_validate(data2013_raw, year = "2013", verbose = TRUE)
```

The data for January through May, July, and August do not pass the validation checks. We can extract these and confirm that there are not enough columns in each of these releases Once we have that confirmed, we can standardize that month and re-run our validation.

```{r fix-month13}
# January - extract data, unit test, and standardize
expect_equal(ncol(cs_extract_month(data2013_raw, month = "January")), 18)
data2013_raw <- cs_standardize(data2013_raw, month = "January", config = 18)

# February - extract data, unit test, and standardize
expect_equal(ncol(cs_extract_month(data2013_raw, month = "February")), 18)
data2013_raw <- cs_standardize(data2013_raw, month = "February", config = 18)

# March - extract data, unit test, and standardize
expect_equal(ncol(cs_extract_month(data2013_raw, month = "March")), 18)
data2013_raw <- cs_standardize(data2013_raw, month = "March", config = 18)

# April - extract data, unit test, and standardize
expect_equal(ncol(cs_extract_month(data2013_raw, month = "April")), 18)
data2013_raw <- cs_standardize(data2013_raw, month = "April", config = 18)

# May - extract data, unit test, and standardize
expect_equal(ncol(cs_extract_month(data2013_raw, month = "May")), 18)
data2013_raw <- cs_standardize(data2013_raw, month = "May", config = 18)

# July - extract data, unit test, and standardize
expect_equal(ncol(cs_extract_month(data2013_raw, month = "July")), 18)
data2013_raw <- cs_standardize(data2013_raw, month = "July", config = 18)

# August - extract data, unit test, and standardize
expect_equal(ncol(cs_extract_month(data2013_raw, month = "August")), 18)
data2013_raw <- cs_standardize(data2013_raw, month = "August", config = 18)

# validate data
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2013_raw, year = "2013"), TRUE)
```

We now get a `TRUE` value for `cs_validate()` and can move on to collapsing our raw data objects to create a new object, `crime2013`, that contains all known 2013 crimes including those that were reported or upgraded in subsequent years:

```{r collapse-data13}
# collapse into single object
data2013_raw <- cs_collapse(data2013_raw)

# combine and filter
cs_combine(type = "year", date = 2013, data2018_raw, data2017_raw, data2016_raw, data2015_raw, data2014_raw, data2013_raw) %>%
  cs_filter_count(var = count) -> crime2013
```

### 2012
We'll repeat the validation process with the 2012 data:

```{r validate-data12}
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2012_raw, year = "2012"), FALSE)
```

Since we fail the validation, we can use the `verbose = TRUE` option to get a summary of where validation issues are occuring. 

```{r validate-data12-verbose}
cs_validate(data2012_raw, year = "2012", verbose = TRUE)
```

Every month contains the incorrect number of variables. We'll address each of these:

```{r fix-month12}
# January - extract data, unit test
expect_equal(ncol(cs_extract_month(data2012_raw, month = "January")), 18)

# standardize
data2012_raw <- cs_standardize(data2012_raw, month = "all", config = 18)

# validate data
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2012_raw, year = "2012"), TRUE)
```

We now get a `TRUE` value for `cs_validate()` and can move on to collapsing our raw data objects to create a new object, `crime2012`, that contains all known 2012 crimes including those that were reported or upgraded in subsequent years:

```{r collapse-data12}
# collapse into single object
data2012_raw <- cs_collapse(data2012_raw)

# combine and filter
cs_combine(type = "year", date = 2012, data2018_raw, data2017_raw, data2016_raw, data2015_raw, data2014_raw, data2013_raw, data2012_raw) %>%
  cs_filter_count(var = count) -> crime2012
```

### 2011
We'll repeat the validation process with the 2011 data:

```{r validate-data11}
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2011_raw, year = "2011"), FALSE)
```

Since we fail the validation, we can use the `verbose = TRUE` option to get a summary of where validation issues are occuring. 

```{r validate-data11-verbose}
cs_validate(data2011_raw, year = "2011", verbose = TRUE)
```

Every month contains the incorrect number of variables. We'll address each of these:

```{r fix-month11}
# January - extract data, unit test
expect_equal(ncol(cs_extract_month(data2011_raw, month = "January")), 18)

# standardize
data2011_raw <- cs_standardize(data2011_raw, month = "all", config = 18)

# validate data
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2011_raw, year = "2011"), TRUE)
```

We now get a `TRUE` value for `cs_validate()` and can move on to collapsing our raw data objects to create a new object, `crime2011`, that contains all known 2011 crimes including those that were reported or upgraded in subsequent years:

```{r collapse-data11}
# collapse into single object
data2011_raw <- cs_collapse(data2011_raw)

# combine and filter
cs_combine(type = "year", date = 2011, data2018_raw, data2017_raw, data2016_raw, data2015_raw, data2014_raw, data2013_raw, data2012_raw, data2011_raw) %>%
  cs_filter_count(var = count) -> crime2011
```

### 2010
We'll repeat the validation process with the 2010 data:

```{r validate-data10}
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2010_raw, year = "2010"), FALSE)
```

Since we fail the validation, we can use the `verbose = TRUE` option to get a summary of where validation issues are occuring. 

```{r validate-data10-verbose}
cs_validate(data2010_raw, year = "2010", verbose = TRUE)
```

Every month contains the incorrect number of variables. We'll address each of these:

```{r fix-month10}
# January - extract data, unit test
expect_equal(ncol(cs_extract_month(data2010_raw, month = "January")), 18)

# standardize all months
data2010_raw <- cs_standardize(data2010_raw, month = "all", config = 18)

# validate data
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2010_raw, year = "2010"), TRUE)
```

We now get a `TRUE` value for `cs_validate()` and can move on to collapsing our raw data objects to create a new object, `crime2010`, that contains all known 2010 crimes including those that were reported or upgraded in subsequent years:

```{r collapse-data10}
# collapse into single object
data2010_raw <- cs_collapse(data2010_raw)

# combine and filter
cs_combine(type = "year", date = 2010, data2018_raw, data2017_raw, data2016_raw, data2015_raw, data2014_raw, data2013_raw, data2012_raw, data2011_raw, data2010_raw) %>%
  cs_filter_count(var = count) -> crime2010
```

### 2009
We'll repeat the validation process with the 2009 data:

```{r validate-data09}
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2009_raw, year = "2009"), FALSE)
```

Since we fail the validation, we can use the `verbose = TRUE` option to get a summary of where validation issues are occuring. 

```{r validate-data09-verbose}
cs_validate(data2009_raw, year = "2009", verbose = TRUE)
```

Every month contains the incorrect number of variables. We'll address each of these:

```{r fix-month09}
# January - extract data, unit test
expect_equal(ncol(cs_extract_month(data2009_raw, month = "January")), 18)

# standardize all months
data2009_raw <- cs_standardize(data2009_raw, month = "all", config = 18)

# validate data
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2009_raw, year = "2009"), TRUE)
```

We now get a `TRUE` value for `cs_validate()` and can move on to collapsing our raw data objects to create a new object, `crime2009`, that contains all known 2009 crimes including those that were reported or upgraded in subsequent years:

```{r collapse-data09}
# collapse into single object
data2009_raw <- cs_collapse(data2009_raw)

# combine and filter
cs_combine(type = "year", date = 2009, data2018_raw, data2017_raw, data2016_raw, data2015_raw, data2014_raw, data2013_raw, data2012_raw, data2011_raw, data2010_raw, data2009_raw) %>%
  cs_filter_count(var = count) -> crime2009
```

### 2008
We'll repeat the validation process with the 2008 data:

```{r validate-data08}
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2008_raw, year = "2008"), FALSE)
```

Since we fail the validation, we can use the `verbose = TRUE` option to get a summary of where validation issues are occuring. 

```{r validate-data08-verbose}
cs_validate(data2008_raw, year = "2008", verbose = TRUE)
```

Every month contains the incorrect number of variables. We'll address each of these:

```{r fix-month08}
# January - extract data, unit test,
expect_equal(ncol(cs_extract_month(data2008_raw, month = "January")), 18)

# standardize all months
data2008_raw <- cs_standardize(data2008_raw, month = "all", config = 18)

# validate data
expect_equal(cs_validate(data2008_raw, year = "2008"), TRUE)
```

We now get a `TRUE` value for `cs_validate()` and can move on to collapsing our raw data objects to create a new object, `crime2008`, that contains all known 2008 crimes including those that were reported or upgraded in subsequent years:

```{r collapse-data08}
# collapse into single object
data2008_raw <- cs_collapse(data2008_raw)

# combine and filter
cs_combine(type = "year", date = 2008, data2018_raw, data2017_raw, data2016_raw, data2015_raw, data2014_raw, data2013_raw, data2012_raw, data2011_raw, data2010_raw, data2009_raw, data2008_raw) %>%
  cs_filter_count(var = count) -> crime2008
```

## Clean-up Enviornment
We can remove the `_raw` objects at this point:

```{r remove-raw}
rm(data2008_raw, data2009_raw, data2010_raw, data2011_raw, data2012_raw, data2013_raw, data2014_raw, data2015_raw, data2016_raw, data2017_raw, data2018_raw)
```

## Create Single Table
Next, we'll create a single table before we remove individual years. We also subset columns to reduce the footprint of the table.

```{r collapse-all}
bind_rows(crime2008, crime2009, crime2010, crime2011, crime2012, crime2013, crime2014, crime2015, crime2016, crime2017, crime2018) %>%
  select(cs_year, date_occur, crime, description, ileads_address, ileads_street, x_coord, y_coord) -> allCrimes
```

### Clean-up Enviornment
We'll remove excess objects again:

```{r remove-years}
rm(crime2008, crime2009, crime2010, crime2011, crime2012, crime2013, crime2014, crime2015, crime2016, crime2017, crime2018)
```

## Subset Homicides
Now that we have a slimmed down data set, we'll subset it by identifying only homicidies that occured between 2008 and 2018:

```{r subset-homicides}
allHomicides <- cs_filter_crime(allCrimes, var = crime, crime = "murder")
```
